```
Usage: catalyze invites send EMAIL [-m | -a]

Arguments:

`invites send` invites a new user to your environment's organization. The only piece of information required is the email address to send the invitation to. The invited user will join the organization as a basic member, unless otherwise specified with the `-a` flag. The recipient does **not** need to have a Dashboard account in order to send them an invitation. However, they will need to have a Dashboard account to accept the invitation. Here is a sample command

```
catalyze invites send coworker@catalyze.io -a
```
