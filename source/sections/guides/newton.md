#1. First Things First

When starting to use Newton, the very first thing you'll need to do is sign up for a Catalyze account. This is done via the dashboard [here](//dashboard.catalyze.io/signup). If you already have a dashboard account you may continue using that one.

Once you've got your account setup and ready you can navigate to [newton.catalyze.io](//newton.catalyze.io) and sign in.

#2. Clusters

Once logged in you'll be taken to a view of your clusters, a group of mirth and postgres services that work together to serve your interfaces. Your clusters list will look something like this:

Currently, your options here are limited. However you do have the ability to add a cluster of which you've been invited. Cluster invite codes will be emailed to you by the cluster administrator.

#3. Interfaces (Details)

Now that you've logged in and have a list of your clusters, you may click the "Details" button to view the interfaces associated with that cluster.

The interfaces details view gives you important metrics about your interfaces. From here you may also choose to invite a user to the cluster. Alternatively you may also remove a user that has been given access.
